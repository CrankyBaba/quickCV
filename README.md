# quickCV
Online CV creator web application created with PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap and Ajax.

The project is still in development and have many bugs!!!

To import all the required table:
1.Please create a databse name testing (this name was used in development)
2.Import the file named testing.sql from the respositry to your localhost databse.

And store all the content inside htdocs folder (in my case i am using XAMPP server.)
